One way to overcome this obstacle is to use technique such as spatial pyramid pooling~\cite{spatialpool}, however it is not siutable for a point cloud representation since the dimensions of such point cloud will be $n\times3$.

Another possible approach to use could be PointNet~\cite{pointnet}, however since we want to be able to have point cloud as an output of the network as well, this approach seem to be unsuitable. This is the reasoning why point cloud representation is not suitable at all.
