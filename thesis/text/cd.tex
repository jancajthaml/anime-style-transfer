\chapter{Contents of the enclosed CD} \label{cd}

The enclosed CD contains two directories, \texttt{thesis} and \texttt{code} and one TAR archive (\texttt{data.tar.gz}) containing examples of generated data. The folder \texttt{thesis} contains this document and all the source files needed for compiling it from the scratch. There is also a \texttt{Makefile} in this directory for easier compilation of the final document.

The folder \texttt{code} contains all the code created for the purposes of this thesis as described in the chapter \ref{programs} with the same folder structure.

The TAR archive \texttt{data.tar.gz} contains an example of generated data by various models. It also contains \texttt{params.flagfile} file containing the parameters used for training various models by the \hyperref[trainpy]{\texttt{train.py}} script. Last thing contained are the exported binary protobuf models that can be used for generating your own data. Due to space limitations of the DVD, only 20 generated examples are included for each model.
