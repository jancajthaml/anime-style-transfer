\section{Thesis structure}
In this first chapter we set up a motivation and reasoning for this work. The next chapter is an overview of a related theoretical work. The first section of said chapter briefly summarizes recent work in the field, while the next section explores more deeply neural networks used in this thesis. The last section of this chapter describes operation of LiDAR which we are trying to simulate in chapter \ref{experiments}.

Chapter \ref{dataset} is dedicated to used datasets and is divided into two parts corresponding to depth and RGB datasets. In this chapter we summarize key characteristics of the datasets and how they were obtained.

Chapter \ref{programs} describes all the programs written for the purpose of this thesis and shows their functionality. This chapter can also serve as a user guide for the programs.

Chapter \ref{experiments} is a showcase of performed experiments. We also describe all the drawbacks we encountered during the experiments. The chapter ends with an evaluation of results.

In the last chapter we analyze all the results and discuss the contribution of this thesis, followed by plans for the future work and conclusion.
